# ysoisochrone

`ysoisochrone` is a Python package using Bayesian inference to estimate stellar ages and masses from evolutionary tracks in the HR diagram.

## Installation

```bash 
pip install .
```
## References

The young stellar objects (pre-main-sequence) evolutionary tracks mainly include the ones from the following works.

### Methods
The Bayesian inference method  is introduced by Pascucci et al. (2016) *add citation*, ... (introduction here, including saying the likelihood function is following Andrews et al. (2013)), and using the tracks from Baraffe and Feiden.
