	abstract = {Context. The unrivalled astrometric and photometric capabilities of the Gaia mission have given new impetus to the study of young stars: both from an environmental perspective, as members of comoving star-forming regions, and from an individual perspective, as targets amenable to planet-hunting direct-imaging observations. Aims: In view of the large availability of theoretical evolutionary models, both fields would benefit from a unified framework that allows a straightforward comparison of physical parameters obtained by different stellar and substellar models. Methods: To this aim, we developed the Manifold Age Determination for Young Stars (madys), a flexible Python tool for the age and mass determination of young stellar and substellar objects. In this first release, madys automatically retrieves and crossmatches photometry from several catalogs, estimates interstellar extinction, and derives age and mass estimates for individual objects through isochronal fitting. Results: Harmonizing the heterogeneity of publicly available isochrone grids, the tool allows one to choose amongst 17 models, many of which with customizable astrophysical parameters, for a total of {\textasciitilde}110 isochrone grids. Several dedicated plotting functions are provided to allow for an intuitive visual perception of the numerical output. Conclusions: After extensive testing, we have made the tool publicly available. Here, we demonstrate the capabilities of madys, summarizing previously published results as well providing several new examples.},

	abstract = {The accuracy of masses of pre-main-sequence stars derived from their locations on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (HRD) can be tested by comparison with accurate and precise masses determined independently. We present 29 single stars in the Taurus star-forming region (SFR) and 3 in the Ophiuchus SFR with masses measured dynamically to a precision of at least 10\%. Our results include 9 updated mass determinations and 3 that have not had their dynamical masses published before. This list of stars with fundamental, dynamical masses, M dyn, is drawn from a larger list of 39 targets in the Taurus SFR and 6 in the Ophiuchus SFR. Placing the stars with accurate and precise dynamical masses on HRDs that do not include internal magnetic fields underestimates the mass compared to M dyn by about 30\%. Placing them on an HRD that does include magnetic fields yields mass estimates in much better agreement with M dyn, with an average difference between M dyn and the estimated track mass of 0.01 ± 0.02 M ⊙. The ages of the stars, 3-10 MY on tracks that include magnetic fields, is older than the 1-3 MY indicated by the nonmagnetic models. The older ages of T Tauri stars predicted by the magnetic models increase the time available for evolution of their disks and formation of the giant gas exoplanets. The agreement between our M dyn values and the masses on the magnetic field tracks provides indirect support for these older ages.},

	abstract = {Absolute ages of young stars are important for many issues in pre-main-sequence stellar and circumstellar evolution but long have been recognized as difficult to derive and calibrate. In this paper, we use literature spectral types and photometry to construct empirical isochrones in Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams for low mass stars and brown dwarfs in the η Cha, ɛ Cha, and TW Hya Associations and the β Pic and Tuc-Hor Moving Groups. A successful theory of pre-main-sequence evolution should match the shapes of the stellar loci for these groups of young stars. However, when comparing the combined empirical isochrones to isochrones predicted from evolutionary models, discrepancies lead to a spectral type (mass) dependence in stellar age estimates. Improved prescriptions for convection and boundary conditions in the latest models of pre-main-sequence evolution lead to a significantly improved correspondence between empirical and model isochrones, with small offsets at low temperatures that may be explained by observational uncertainties or by model limitations. Independent of model predictions, linear fits to combined stellar loci of these regions provide a simple empirical method to order clusters by luminosity with a reduced dependence on spectral type. Age estimates calculated from various sets of modern models that reproduce Li depletion boundary ages of the β Pic Moving Group also imply a ∼4 Myr age for the low mass members of the Upper Sco OB Association, which is younger than the 11 Myr age that has been recently estimated for intermediate and high mass members.},
